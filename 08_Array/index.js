//An array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single variable
//Array are used to store lists of elements like numbers, strings,objects and even other arrays
//they are zero-indexed, meaning the first elements has an index of 0, the second has index of 1 and so on...

// let arr =["suman",100,30.5, "@"];
// console.log(arr); //access all
// console.log(arr[1]);//access by indexing

// for(let i =0; i <arr.length; i++){ //access by loop
//     console.log(arr[i]);
// }
